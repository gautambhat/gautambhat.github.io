### Software Engineer
**Blend Labs**, San Francisco, CA – (Jun 2020 - Mar 2023)

- Played a crucial role in delivering time-sensitive features for key customers, ensuring successful go-live events and meeting critical deadlines.
- Mentored junior developers and interns through frequent pair programming sessions, fostering skill development and knowledge sharing within the team.
- Collaborated with senior engineers to define roadmaps, feature priorities, and drive the successful execution of projects.
- Spearheaded the development of a loan duplication workflow, which was adopted by all production customers within a year, significantly streamlining loan officers' ability to copy loan data between applications in mere seconds.
- Led the creation of the loan scenario sharing workflow, a time-saving feature that enabled lenders to quickly generate and compare loan products side-by-side, allowing borrowers to choose from financing options and cash-to-close variances. This feature was adopted by 100+ customers, including multiple top 10 US banks, and unblocked the national rollout for one of Blend's top strategic customers. Utilized React/Redux and PostgreSQL to build a user-friendly interface for sharing multiple loan options from a single application ([Blend Loan Officer Toolkit](https://blend.com/products/features/loan-officer-toolkit/)).
- Consolidated business logic across multiple frontends into a single microservice, reducing code duplication and maintenance efforts.
- Optimized the production DB by removing bloat, deleting 2.5M rows without downtime, and improving database performance.
- Improved developer productivity by leading efforts to document features and standardizing node debugging capabilities for multiple microservices.
- Established as the team's go-to expert for technical help and context, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.


### Software Engineer, Applications
**C3.ai**, Redwood City, CA – (Jul 2017 - April 2020)

- Implemented custom semantic version range parsers in the C3 platform, streamlining the upgrade path for dependencies and improving the deployment experience for customers and internal teams.
- Architected on-premise trial for banking client, reducing application review time from 3 months to 1 day, leading to over $1M in subsequent projects, and enabling business expansion in Asia.
- Built low-code/no-code Data Studio, enabling users to rapidly set up, test, and preview data ingestion pipelines.
- Developed metadata-driven React components for ML Studio, reducing configuration time and improving user experience.
- Enhanced code coverage reporting for JavaScript tests on the CI pipeline, contributing to the team's achievement of a 90% test coverage goal for all modules.
